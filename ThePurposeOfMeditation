aim for consistent, daily practice (15-30 mins minimum), focusing on scripture (Philippians 4:8, Joshua 1:8),
not just emptying the mind but filling it with God's truth to build unshakeable inner strength, discipline,
and control over thoughts, transforming into a 'doer of the Word' for profound spiritual power and stillness, rather than a specific hour count.
